For each exercise in #file:exercises.json, make a folder here. Make:

* dataset folder
  * base-data folder: loaded files from the web, do not forget attribution in readme
  * generator folder: for generators
  * finished folder: for finished/generated CSV datasets
* guides folder with mentor/student instructions
  * mentor.md
  * student.md
  Ignore the pdfs for now, but name them uniformally.
  Also copy over the system prompt, tasksheet (student's guide) and merge them accordingly. If in doubt, please feel free to ask!
