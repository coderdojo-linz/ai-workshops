# Recognizing Patterns: _The Datasaurus Secret_

Target Group: Young kids (age 9-12), beginners, no coding experience 

## Story

A seemingly trivial dataset hides a secret. The task: Use data visualization to uncover the hidden pattern.

Dataset files:

- Raw: `./dataset/base-data/datasaurus.csv`
- Parsed (optional): `./dataset/datasaurus-parsed.csv`

## Tool

AI chatbot (Open WebUI; prompt: _Is there a pattern in this data?_)

## Learning Objective

Teach the principle that only the right representation and analysis of data makes connections visible that may remain hidden at first glance.

## Mentor Guide

For facilitator notes, tips, and a step-by-step run-of-show, see `./guides/mentor.md`.

## Kids Handout

For the story, mission, and kid-friendly instructions, see `./guides/kids.md`.

## Quick Start (for mentors)

1. Open the mentor guide: `./guides/mentor.md`.
2. Have kids ask the AI to preview a few rows and then generate a scatter plot of `x` vs `y` with a 1:1 aspect ratio.
3. If multiple groups exist in the `dataset` column, filter to `dino` first to reveal the dinosaur shape.
