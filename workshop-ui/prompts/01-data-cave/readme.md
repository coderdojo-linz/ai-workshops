# Recognizing Patterns: _The Datasaurus Secret_

Target Group: Young kids (age 9-12), beginners, no coding experience

## Story

A seemingly trivial dataset hides a secret. The task: Use data visualization to uncover the hidden pattern.

Dataset files:

- The Base Dataset is the well-known "Datasaurus" dataset by Alberto Cairo: `./base-data/datasaurus.csv`
- A python script to parse the base dataset into a more challenging format: `./base-data/generate-dataset.py`
- Parsed Dataset for the Kids: `./data-cave.csv`

## Tool

AI chatbot with code interpretation capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

- Teach the principle that only the right representation and analysis of data makes connections visible that may remain hidden at first glance.
- Teach the basics of prompting: Kids should learn to guide an AI with clear prompts instead of writing code themselves.
- AI can code for you, but you have to guide it.
