# IT-Forensics: _The Data Thief in Our Company_

Target Group: Young kids (age 9-12), beginners, no coding experience

## Story

In a fictional company, a villain wants to sell secret research data. Participants get access to login logs and use the AI chatbot to identify a suspicious user (e.g., many failed logins followed by a successful one, or logins from distant cities in a short time).

Dataset files:

- The dataset generator script: `./base-data/generate-dataset.py`
- The final dataset for the kids: `./detective-beginners`

## Tool

AI chatbot with code interpretation capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

- Introduction to the world of IT security and the importance of data analysis in solving (digital) criminal cases.
- Teach the basics of prompting: Kids should learn to guide an AI with clear prompts instead of writing code themselves.
- AI can code for you, but you have to guide it.
